It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.\n\nIf you already have a full Ruby development environment with all headers and RubyGems installed, you can create a new Jekyll site by doing the following:\n\nHow to install\n\n# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems\n~ $ gem install jekyll bundler\n\n# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog\n~ $ jekyll new myblog\n\n# Change into your new directory\n~ $ cd myblog\n\n# Build the site on the preview server\n~/myblog $ bundle exec jekyll serve\n\n# Now browse to http://localhost:4000\n\n\nNext steps\n\nBuilding a Jekyll site with the default theme is just the first step. The real magic happens when you start creating blog posts, using the front matter to control templates and layouts, and taking advantage of all the awesome configuration options Jekyll makes available.\n\nBasic usage\n\nThe Jekyll gem makes a jekyll executable available to you in your Terminal window. You can use this command in a number of ways:\n\n$ jekyll build\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site\n\n$ jekyll build --destination &lt;destination&gt;\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;\n\n$ jekyll build --source &lt;source&gt; --destination &lt;destination&gt;\n# =&gt; The &lt;source&gt; folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;\n\n$ jekyll build --watch\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site,\n#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.\n\n\nDirectory structure\n\nJekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. The concept behind the system is this: you give it text written in your favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, and it churns that through a layout or a series of layout files. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more. This is all done through editing text files; the static web site is the final product.\n\nA basic Jekyll site usually looks something like this:\n\n.\n├── _config.yml\n├── _data\n|   └── members.yml\n├── _drafts\n|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.md\n|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.md\n├── _includes\n|   ├── footer.html\n|   └── header.html\n├── _layouts\n|   ├── default.html\n|   └── post.html\n├── _posts\n|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.md\n|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.md\n├── _sass\n|   ├── _base.scss\n|   └── _layout.scss\n├── _site\n├── .jekyll-metadata\n└── index.html # can also be an 'index.md' with valid YAML Frontmatter\n\n\nFront matter\n\nThe front matter is where Jekyll starts to get really cool. Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:\n\n---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Blogging Like a Hacker\n---\n\n\nBetween these triple-dashed lines, you can set predefined variables (see below for a reference) or even create custom ones of your own. These variables will then be available to you to access using Liquid tags both further down in the file and also in any layouts or includes that the page or post in question relies on.\n\n\n\nWhere additional pages live\n\nWhere you put HTML or Markdown files for pages depends on how you want the pages to work. There are two main ways of creating pages:\n\n\n  Place named HTML or Markdown files for each page in your site’s root folder.\n  Place pages inside folders and subfolders named whatever you want.\n\n\nBoth methods work fine (and can be used in conjunction with each other), with the only real difference being the resulting URLs. By default, pages retain the same folder structure in _site as they do in the source directory."

You can use this command in a number of ways:\n\n$ jekyll build\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site\n\n$ jekyll build --destination &lt;destination&gt;\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;\n\n$ jekyll build --source &lt;source&gt; --destination &lt;destination&gt;\n# =&gt; The &lt;source&gt; folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;\n\n$ jekyll build --watch\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site,\n#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.\n\n\nDirectory structure\n\nJekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. The concept behind the system is this: you give it text written in your favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, and it churns that through a layout or a series of layout files. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more. This is all done through editing text files; the static web site is the final product.\n\nA basic Jekyll site usually looks something like this:\n\n.\n├── _config.yml\n├── _data\n|   └── members.yml\n├── _drafts\n|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.md\n|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.md\n├── _includes\n|   ├── footer.html\n|   └── header.html\n├── _layouts\n|   ├── default.html\n|   └── post.html\n├── _posts\n|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.md\n|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.md\n├── _sass\n|   ├── _base.scss\n|   └── _layout.scss\n├── _site\n├── .jekyll-metadata\n└── index.html # can also be an 'index.md' with valid YAML Frontmatter\n\n\nFront matter\n\nThe front matter is where Jekyll starts to get really cool. Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:\n\n---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Blogging Like a Hacker\n---\n\n\nBetween these triple-dashed lines, you can set predefined variables (see below for a reference) or even create custom ones of your own. These variables will then be available to you to access using Liquid tags both further down in the file and also in any layouts or includes that the page or post in question relies on.\n\n\n\nWhere additional pages live\n\nWhere you put HTML or Markdown files for pages depends on how you want the pages to work. There are two main ways of creating pages:\n\n\n  Place named HTML or Markdown files for each page in your site’s root folder.\n  Place pages inside folders and subfolders named whatever you want.\n\n\nBoth methods work fine (and can be used in conjunction with each other), with the only real difference being the resulting URLs. By default, pages retain the same folder structure in _site as they do in the source directory."

It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.\n\nIf you already have a full Ruby development environment with all headers and RubyGems installed, you can create a new Jekyll site by doing the following:\n\nHow to install\n\n# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems\n~ $ gem install jekyll bundler\n\n# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog\n~ $ jekyll new myblog\n\n# Change into your new directory\n~ $ cd myblog\n\n# Build the site on the preview server\n~/myblog $ bundle exec jekyll serve\n\n# Now browse to http://localhost:4000\n\n\nNext steps\n\nBuilding a Jekyll site with the default theme is just the first step. The real magic happens when you start creating blog posts, using the front matter to control templates and layouts, and taking advantage of all the awesome configuration options Jekyll makes available.\n\nBasic usage\n\nThe Jekyll gem makes a jekyll executable available to you in your Terminal window. You can use this command in a number of ways:\n\n$ jekyll build\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site\n\n$ jekyll build --destination &lt;destination&gt;\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;\n\n$ jekyll build --source &lt;source&gt; --destination &lt;destination&gt;\n# =&gt; The &lt;source&gt; folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;\n\n$ jekyll build --watch\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site,\n#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.\n\n\nDirectory structure\n\nJekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. The concept behind the system is this: you give it text written in your favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, and it churns that through a layout or a series of layout files. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more. This is all done through editing text files; the static web site is the final product.\n\nA basic Jekyll site usually looks something like this:\n\n.\n├── _config.yml\n├── _data\n|   └── members.yml\n├── _drafts\n|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.md\n|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.md\n├── _includes\n|   ├── footer.html\n|   └── header.html\n├── _layouts\n|   ├── default.html\n|   └── post.html\n├── _posts\n|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.md\n|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.md\n├── _sass\n|   ├── _base.scss\n|   └── _layout.scss\n├── _site\n├── .jekyll-metadata\n└── index.html # can also be an 'index.md' with valid YAML Frontmatter\n\n\nFront matter\n\nThe front matter is where Jekyll starts to get really cool. Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:\n\n---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Blogging Like a Hacker\n---\n\n\nBetween these triple-dashed lines, you can set predefined variables (see below for a reference) or even create custom ones of your own. These variables will then be available to you to access using Liquid tags both further down in the file and also in any layouts or includes that the page or post in question relies on.\n\n\n\nWhere additional pages live\n\nWhere you put HTML or Markdown files for pages depends on how you want the pages to work. There are two main ways of creating pages:\n\n\n  Place named HTML or Markdown files for each page in your site’s root folder.\n  Place pages inside folders and subfolders named whatever you want.\n\n\nBoth methods work fine (and can be used in conjunction with each other), with the only real difference being the resulting URLs. By default, pages retain the same folder structure in _site as they do in the source directory."

It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.\n\nIf you already have a full Ruby development environment with all headers and RubyGems installed, you can create a new Jekyll site by doing the following:\n\nHow to install\n\n# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems\n~ $ gem install jekyll bundler\n\n# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog\n~ $ jekyll new myblog\n\n# Change into your new directory\n~ $ cd myblog\n\n# Build the site on the preview server\n~/myblog $ bundle exec jekyll serve\n\n# Now browse to http://localhost:4000\n\n\nNext steps\n\nBuilding a Jekyll site with the default theme is just the first step. The real magic happens when you start creating blog posts, using the front matter to control templates and layouts, and taking advantage of all the awesome configuration options Jekyll makes available.\n\nBasic usage\n\nThe Jekyll gem makes a jekyll executable available to you in your Terminal window. You can use this command in a number of ways:\n\n$ jekyll build\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site\n\n$ jekyll build --destination &lt;destination&gt;\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;\n\n$ jekyll build --source &lt;source&gt; --destination &lt;destination&gt;\n# =&gt; The &lt;source&gt; folder will be generated into &lt;destination&gt;\n\n$ jekyll build --watch\n# =&gt; The current folder will be generated into ./_site,\n#    watched for changes, and regenerated automatically.\n\n\nDirectory structure\n\nJekyll is, at its core, a text transformation engine. The concept behind the system is this: you give it text written in your favorite markup language, be that Markdown, Textile, or just plain HTML, and it churns that through a layout or a series of layout files. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more. This is all done through editing text files; the static web site is the final product.\n\nA basic Jekyll site usually looks something like this:\n\n.\n├── _config.yml\n├── _data\n|   └── members.yml\n├── _drafts\n|   ├── begin-with-the-crazy-ideas.md\n|   └── on-simplicity-in-technology.md\n├── _includes\n|   ├── footer.html\n|   └── header.html\n├── _layouts\n|   ├── default.html\n|   └── post.html\n├── _posts\n|   ├── 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.md\n|   └── 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.md\n├── _sass\n|   ├── _base.scss\n|   └── _layout.scss\n├── _site\n├── .jekyll-metadata\n└── index.html # can also be an 'index.md' with valid YAML Frontmatter\n\n\nFront matter\n\nThe front matter is where Jekyll starts to get really cool. Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines. Here is a basic example:\n\n---\nlayout: post\ntitle: Blogging Like a Hacker\n---\n\n\nBetween these triple-dashed lines, you can set predefined variables (see below for a reference) or even create custom ones of your own. These variables will then be available to you to access using Liquid tags both further down in the file and also in any layouts or includes that the page or post in question relies on.\n\n\n\nWhere additional pages live\n\nWhere you put HTML or Markdown files for pages depends on how you want the pages to work. There are two main ways of creating pages:\n\n\n  Place named HTML or Markdown files for each page in your site’s root folder.\n  Place pages inside folders and subfolders named whatever you want.\n\n\nBoth methods work fine (and can be used in conjunction with each other), with the only real difference being the resulting URLs. By default, pages retain the same folder structure in _site as they do in the source directory."

These are called Editable Regions and are set by adding a class of editable to HTML elements.\n\nOpen index.html in CloudCannon and add a class of editable to the h1 and p inside &lt;div class=\"header-content-inner\"&gt; so it becomes the following:\n\n&lt;div class=\"header-content-inner\"&gt;\n  &lt;h1 class=\"editable\"&gt;Your Favorite Source of Free Bootstrap Themes&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;hr&gt;\n  &lt;p class=\"editable\"&gt;Start Bootstrap can help you build better websites using the Bootstrap CSS framework!

The client can update content directly inline by clicking on text:\n\nBy clicking Collections in the sidebar the client can manage their blog posts:\n\nEditing posts happens in the Content Editor which is a rich text editor for Markdown. The client can also manage all the front matter data on the page using an easy-to-use editor:\n\nOr we can use the Visual Editor to update posts:\n\nThe client can also update collection items using the same editor.
